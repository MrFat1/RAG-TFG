MRN: 654321
Admitted: 
Date: May 20 2024
Dict: Dr. Emily Smith
Attend: Dr. Robert Johnson
REASON FOR CONSULTATION: Severe chest pain.
We are asked to evaluate this pleasant 75-year-old man with a history of 
diabetes and hypertension. The patient was recently admitted to City Hospital 
for chest pain. The patient was noted at that time to have an elevated troponin level. 
As part of the patient's assessment, he underwent a coronary angiography which revealed 
significant stenosis for which he was treated with stenting. Initially, he did well. 
However, he subsequently developed recurrent chest pain and was evaluated by Dr. Sarah Brown 
and sent to the emergency department for further evaluation and treatment. Mr. Doe 
reports that he has had no significant fevers or chills. He does have a mild cough which is 
non-productive. He has a remote smoking history, having quit more than 30 years ago. The patient 
admits to a diet high in fatty foods. He reports no significant changes in bowel or bladder function. 
He denies any skin lesions, rashes, changes in vision or hearing. He denies any constitutional symptoms 
other than chest pain.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Otherwise negative.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: His past medical history is notable for type 2 diabetes mellitus, 
hypertension, coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction, and hyperlipidemia.
MEDICATIONS: His outpatient medications include
1. Metformin.
2. Lisinopril.
3. Atorvastatin.
4. Aspirin.
5. Clopidogrel.
6. Metoprolol.
SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is retired, lives with his wife, has two daughters. No alcohol, 
remote tobacco use as mentioned.
FAMILY HISTORY: Positive for coronary artery disease and diabetes.
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As outlined.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: A pleasant elderly Caucasian male, in no acute distress. 
Vital Signs: Pulse 74, blood pressure 150/80, respiratory rate 16, saturation 96% on room air. 
Oropharynx is clear without exudate or erythema. No jugular venous distention. Chest reveals 
clear breath sounds bilaterally. Cardiac Exam: Regular rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. 
Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no hepatosplenomegaly. Lower Extremities: No edema, no clubbing or cyanosis.
Neurologically: Alert and oriented, no focal deficits.
Chest x-ray: No acute infiltrates, no pleural effusions. Additional laboratories notable for 
sodium of 138, potassium 4.0, serum CO2 of 25, BUN and creatinine 18 and 1.1 respectively. 
White count 6000, hemoglobin 13.5, platelets 250. Troponin on admission was 0.2, repeat was less than 0.01.
IMPRESSION: A 75-year-old male admitted with recurrent chest pain. The patient has 
a history of coronary artery disease and recent stenting. Chest pain likely secondary to 
coronary artery spasm. Will continue current medical management and monitor. 
No need for further invasive procedures at this time. Follow-up with cardiology recommended.
Thank you for allowing us to participate in this patient's care.
