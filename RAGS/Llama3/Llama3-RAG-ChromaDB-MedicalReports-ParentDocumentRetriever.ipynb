I was present for the patient's initial evaluation by the Trauma \\nService. I did review the trauma flow sheet and agreed with its content \\nunless noted otherwise below.   \\nThis is a 17-year-old female patient who was the unrestrained driver in a \\nmotor vehicle collision. The vehicle reportedly flipped and did shear off a \\nutility pole. The patient denies striking her head, although she was noted \\nto have an occipital scalp laceration. She denied any loss of consciousness \\nwith this. She denies any complaints of neck pain. No chest pain. No \\nabdominal pain. She states that she is having pain at present to her right \\nupper arm, as well as her left calf. She denies any numbness or weakness in \\nher extremities. The patient's review of systems is as above. The remaining \\nsystems were negative.\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\\nNone.\\nMEDICATIONS:\\nOral contraceptives.\\nALLERGIES:\\nTHE PATIENT HAS NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES. \\nTETANUS:\\nThe patient was unsure of her last tetanus immunization.\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:\\nNegative for alcohol use.  \\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\\nThe patient's physical examination showed her to be awake and alert in no \\ndistress. Her GCS was 15. Vital signs upon arrival to the trauma bay showed \\nher to have a blood pressure of 122/84, pulse rate 88, respirations 16, \\noxygen saturation 98% on room air, and temperature 36.7. The patient's HEENT \\nshowed her to have a 2 cm laceration on the occipital region of the scalp. \\nHer pupils were equal and reactive. Extraocular movements were intact. The \\npatient's TMs were clear bilaterally. The patient's neck was without \\ncervical spine tenderness. The patient's oropharynx showed no evidence of \\nintraoral trauma. The chest was nontender on palpation. Breath sounds were \\nequal bilaterally. The heart was normal S1 and S2. The abdomen was soft, \\nnontender, and nondistended. The pelvis was nontender on palpation. The \\npatient did have some pain on palpation to the soft tissue of the right upper \\narm, as well as to the calf muscles in the left leg. Neurologic examination \\nshowed intact motor and sensory function.\\nED COURSE:\\nThe patient's ED course did consist of a chest x-ray showing no evidence of \\nacute rib fractures or pneumothorax. Pelvis x-ray was limited but showed no \\ngross evidence of fracture. The patient's H&H was 14.6 and 45. Glucose \\nwas 95, sodium 143, potassium 4.1. The patient did undergo a CT scan of the \\nhead showing no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. CT scan of the cervical \\nspine was negative for any evidence of fracture or subluxation. CT scan of \\nthe chest, abdomen and pelvis ruled out fracture, thoracic or abdominal \\ninjury. The laceration was repaired by the Trauma Service with staples here \\nin the Emergency Department under my supervision. The patient did also have \\na CT scan of the thoracic spine which did have preliminary read of possible \\ncompression fracture at T8. This was relayed to the Trauma Service. The \\npatient will be admitted to the Trauma Service at this time for further \\nevaluation, management and observation.\\nADMITTING DIAGNOSIS(ES):\\n1. CLOSED HEAD INJURY.  \\n2. 2 cm OCCIPITAL SCALP LACERATION.\\n3. MULTIPLE CONTUSIONS.\\n4.

After reviewing the history, \\nphysical examination and medical decision making with the resident physician, \\nDr. **NAME[TTT SSS], as documented separately by him.  The nurses notes were \\nreviewed as well. \\nThe patient is a **AGE[in 40s]-year-old male with no significant past medical history, \\nwho presents for reassessment of persistent headache.  The patient states \\nthat approximately four weeks ago he had onset of headache, which was \\ninitially somewhat sharp and then became a constant, throbbing, aching pain \\nin his right occipital region posteriorly in the base of his head.  He took \\nsome Motrin and that somewhat alleviated it.  He then had subsequently \\nre-exacerbation of her it.  He was evaluated by his PCP and had CT scan with \\nand without contrast, which was normal and he was seen in the Emergency \\nDepartment as well.  The patient is currently awaiting evaluation by \\nneurologist on **DATE[Mar 15].  He is concerned that he cannot wait that long.  \\nHe states that he is not in excruciating pain but significant enough to be \\nbothersome to him. It is now somewhat throbbing pain and at time aching pain \\nand it is fairly localized in the right occipital region.  He does note any \\nspecific pain in his neck, but he has noted some pain with certain movements \\nin his right shoulder particularly with forward flexion of his shoulder and \\nfelt that his arm was somewhat sore and weak when he was attempting to bowl \\ntwo days ago.  He has not noted any frank weakness in his grip or in the use \\nof his arm other than with that particular motion.  He denied any recent \\ntrauma.  He has had no fever or chills.  He has had no upper respiratory \\nsymptoms.  He has had no pain with neck movement.  He denies nausea, \\nvomiting, light-headedness or dizziness.  He has no difficulty with his gait. \\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:    \\nThe rest of the review of systems were negative.\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   \\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY, MEDICATIONS, ALLERGIES, AND SOCIAL HISTORY:  As per the \\nresident's dictation. \\nPHYSICAL EXAM:  \\nThe patient is a well-nourished, well-developed pleasant male in minimal \\ndiscomfort.   \\nVital Signs:  Pulse 84, respirations 14, blood pressure 120/88.  \\nHEENT exam was normocephalic and atraumatic.  There was no significant scalp \\ntenderness.  His oropharynx is clear and moist.  Sclerae and conjunctivae are \\nclear.  Tympanic membranes are clear.  Mastoid area was nontender without \\nerythema.  External auditory canal appeared clear.  There was no significant \\nfocal neck tenderness or limitation of neck movement.  He did have certain \\ndiscomfort when moving his shoulder and certain motion such as anterior \\nflexion.   \\nIn testing muscle function and sensation in the distal right upper extremity \\nthere was no focal weakness.  He had no respiratory distress.  Motor and \\nsensory function in the lower extremities was normal and gait was normal. \\nED COURSE:  \\nOur impression is that this patient has persistent headache now for \\napproximately one month.  He has no significant associated neurologic \\nsymptoms other than the potential pain and weakness with certain movements of \\nhis right upper extremity.  These are not of acute onset.   \\nIt was felt that the patient's pain is potentially from cervical spinal cord \\nnerve root impingement or stenosis.  We discussed the situation with the \\npatient.  He is agreeable to plan to obtain outpatient MRI of the cervical \\nspine and brain and to follow up with a primary care physician once this test \\nis done within the next few days for appropriate referral and management.  \\nThe patient was advised of signs and symptoms for which to return to ED. \\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS(ES):  \\nEXACERBATION OF SUBACUTE HEADACHE.\\n \\n___________________________________\\n**NAME[YYY M.

The patient has \\ncontinued to complain of pain to her right hand but this localized to the \\nulnar aspect of her right hand.  She denies any paresthesias or numbness.  \\nShe denies any significant decrease in her range of motion.  She admits to a \\nprior hand history of wrist fracture in the 1970s which required closed \\nreduction.  She has no other hand history.   \\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\\nMedical history includes:\\n1. Left mastectomy.\\n2. Noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.\\n3. Arthritis.\\n4. Fibromyalgia.\\nMEDICATIONS: \\nUnknown to the patient.\\nALLERGIES:\\nNO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES.\\nSOCIAL HISTORY: \\nThe patient is a two-pack per day tobacco user.  She denies alcohol or drug \\nuse.  She is married.  The patient is disabled secondary to osteoarthritis of \\nher knees.     \\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:\\nAs HPI; otherwise, within normal limits.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: \\nGeneral:  A well-developed, well-nourished **AGE[in 50s]-year-old, white female, who is \\nsitting comfortably in a hospital bed in no acute distress.  She is awake, \\nalert, and oriented times three.   \\nVital signs:  Afebrile, vital signs stable. \\nExtremity exam:  There is no gross deformity noted to her bilateral upper \\nextremities.  There is an area of edema and ecchymosis to her right hand to \\nthe ulnar aspect aligning with her right fifth metacarpal.  There are no open \\nwounds to the hand.

She does drink occasional alcohol, one or two drinks a month. \\nPHYSICAL EXAM:  \\nVital signs:  Temperature 36.8, pulse 64, respirations 16, blood pressure \\n108/60. \\nIn general, she is awake, alert, oriented, times three, and in no acute \\ndistress. \\nHEENT exam reveals she has diffuse edema of the left eye.  Her eyelid is \\nswollen.  She has a small ulceration on her left temple with surrounding \\nedema and erythema.  There is no active drainage from the site.  There is no \\nfluctuant mass. \\nCardiac:  Regular rate and rhythm.  S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.\\nThe lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.\\nAbdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended.  Positive active Bowel sounds are \\npresent. \\nExtremities:  No cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.\\nCBC was obtained which showed a white blood cell count of 15.2, H&H 11.3 \\nand 32.5, platelets 176. \\nA CT of the orbits were obtained which revealed left facial and preseptal \\nperiorbital inflammation consistent with cellulitis.  Her orbital contents \\nand globes are intact.  There are no bony lesion.  There is some mild mucosal \\nthickening of the inferior aspects of the maxillary sinuses.  The remaining \\nsinuses are clear. \\nED COURSE:  \\nThis is a **AGE[in 20s]-year-old with left eye cellulitis.  CT was obtained to rule out \\neye involvement.  Per the CT there was no orbital content involvement.  The \\npatient  did receive Unasyn 3 gram IV while in the Emergency Department, as \\nwell as, Dilaudid for pain control.  Due to the fact that there is no eye \\ninvolvement, it was felt that the patient  could be treated with p.o. \\nantibiotics. \\nThe patient was discharged to home.  She was given a prescription for Bactrim \\nDS b.i.d. to take for 10 days.  She was told to follow up with her PCP \\ntomorrow. She states she will call them tomorrow and be seen or return to the \\nEmergency Department.  The patient  was understanding of all of the \\ninstructions and in agreement with the plan. \\nThe case was discussed with Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] who is in full agreement with the plan.\\nPROCEDURE(S):  \\nPLAN/FOLLOW-UP: \\nATTENDING PHYSICIAN ADDENDUM:  \\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS(ES):  \\n___________________________________\\n**NAME[YYY M ZZZ], M.D.\\n \\nDictator:  **NAME[WWW XXX], M.D.\\n**INITIALS\\nD:  **DATE[Mar 01 2007] 23:44:54\\nT:  **DATE[Mar 02 2007] 08:55:15\\nR:  **DATE[Mar 02 2007] 08:55:15/hmj\\nJob ID:  328095/**ID-NUM\\nCc:\\n \\n*** Dictated By: -**NAME[XXX, TTT] ***\\nElectronically Signed by **NAME[YYY ZZZ]  **DATE[Mar 15 2007] 02:30:44 PM', metadata={'source': 'report14.xml', 'subtype': 'EVAL', 'type': 'ER', 'chief_complaint': 'INSECT BITE', 'admit_diagnosis': '682.9', 'discharge_diagnosis': '682.0,282.60,', 'year': '2007', 'downlaod_time': '', 'deid': 'v.6.22.06.0'})]\n",
